# RE1-Autosplitter

To use this autosplitter, in LiveSplit enter the name of the game as one of the following:
* Biohazard
* Biohazard 1
* Resident Evil
* Resident Evil 1
* BH1
* RE1

The program exe must be named "Biohazard.exe".

## Supported Categories

All main board categories are supported with routed door splits. Set your category and split type by selecting the appropriate option from each group under "Routed Splits". Make sure to ONLY CHOOSE ONE option from each group, otherwise the splits will not work.
There are also three route alterations you can apply to the splits:
* "Bank when entering Guardhouse" - For Jill 100% Knife Only (NMG or MG) categories and every Chris category. This switches the bank in Guardhouse to the first thing you do upon entering, instead of on the way out.
* "Skip Plant 42 Glitch" - This skips the 2 door splits for getting the flame rounds in the 002 bathroom and the 2 splits for reloading the Plant 42 boss. Only applies to Jill MG No Restriction categories. (Removes 4 splits total)
* "Skip Plant 42 Fight Reload" - This skips the two door splits for reloading the Plant 42 fight. The split for the Plant 42 fight will then only split after defeating the boss (requires you to have the Helmet Key when leaving the room). This can be used in every Chris category and is also useful if you're running Jill Major Glitches, but do not plan to reset over a missed Plant 42 Glitch. (Removes 2 splits total)

## Checkpoint Splits -- by SHiiDO (default option)

These split on every door, but hold up at specific checkpoint splits based on the split name. You can leave some names off to remove the checkpoint. Use these for category extension runs since there are no routes specifically for them included in this autosplitter. These split names are in quotes below:
* "Mansion 1"
* "Courtyard 1"
* "Guardhouse"
* "Courtyard 2"
* "Mansion 2"
* "Courtyard 3"
* "Underground"
* "Laboratory - End" or "End"

## Basic Door Splits

This option will split on EVERY door transition you make!

## Key Item Splits

If you'd like to split on key items, this is the option for you! These are compatible with all of the door splits and the segment splits. This is fully customizable so you can pick and choose which items you'd like to split on. The key items are grouped according to typical items you'd pick up in a main category run and additional items that you can split on.
